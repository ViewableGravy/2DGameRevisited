Base stats:
    Obviously a player has there base stats such as speed, agility, etc. 
    These effects will cause you to attack faster or deal extra damage against damage types
Monster fighter stats:
    When you originally fight a monster you have a 0.5x multiplier on damage against that enemy type.
    because of this you deal less damage. 
    The more you fight a monster the less affected you are. for example, if you have fought a slime 500 times,
    you will have a 1x multiplier against slimes. if you fight slimes maybe 10,000 times you may have a 2x multiplier
    on damage against slimes.

    If there are multiple tiers of a similar lvl, e.g. green slime (tier 1), gold slime(tier 4) you will gain progress towards 
    damaging that monster type. with that said, obviously this system will be modified depending on monster.
    Killing a raid boss for example, 10K times is not realistic so you may have to kill it less to get the bonuses
    whereas killing a slime is relatively easy and therefore requires far more time to compensate for how easy it is.

    Of course in some cases (e.g. slime), you may not care you have a 0.5x mult on damage since you already do 50x it'slimes
    health in damage at base. There will be an achievement system that reflects your progress though
skills:
    on top of stats and buffs you also have skills which allow you to do unique things such as cast magic or sword skills

Updating stats:
    your stats and skills from killing enemies are not updated until you reach your home and have access to your
    stat updating potion


as for levels, lets be honest, i just wanna use dan machi's system
